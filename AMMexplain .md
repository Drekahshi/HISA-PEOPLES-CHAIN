Overview
The hisa_amm.py script implements an Automated Market Maker (AMM) for the HISA ecosystem, a decentralized platform focused on conservation (JANI), financial empowerment (UMOJA), and cultural preservation (CHAT). The script provides an interactive command-line interface to simulate swaps, calculate liquidity provider (LP) rewards, analyze arbitrage opportunities, and display pool and ecosystem information.
The AMM uses a constant product formula (x * y = k) and supports multiple token pairs, including HISA, USDC, JANI, CHAT, UMOJA, and others. It includes features like fee collection, liquidity addition, and reward calculations with a high APY multiplier for LP rewards.
Features

Swap Calculator: Simulate and execute token swaps with price impact and fee calculations.
Liquidity Provider Rewards Calculator: Estimate LP rewards, including APY (with a 16.725x multiplier) and ROI over a specified period.
Pool Information: Display reserves, prices, TVL, and trading fees for each liquidity pool.
Arbitrage Opportunity Calculator: Analyze potential arbitrage profits based on external market prices.
Ecosystem Overview: Detailed view of JANI, UMOJA, and CHAT ecosystems, including their pools and mechanisms.
Simplified Ecosystem Overview: A lightweight version of the ecosystem overview without AMM dependencies.
Token Price Estimation: Calculate token prices in USDC based on pool reserves.

Requirements

Python: Version 3.6 or higher
Dependencies: 
decimal (standard library)
typing (standard library)
dataclasses (standard library, Python 3.7+)
 **Jupyter Notebook** or **Jupyter Lab**

No external packages are required.
Installation

Save the script as hisa_amm.py.
Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed on your system.
Run the script directly; no additional setup is needed.

python hisa_amm.py

Usage

Run the Script:
python hisa_amm.py

This launches the interactive calculator.

Interactive Menu:Upon running, youâ€™ll see a menu with the following options:

1. Swap Calculator: Simulate or execute a token swap.
2. Liquidity Provider Rewards Calculator: Calculate rewards for providing liquidity.
3. Pool Information: View details of a specific liquidity pool.
4. Arbitrage Opportunity Calculator: Check for arbitrage opportunities.
5. Ecosystem Overview: Explore the JANI, UMOJA, and CHAT ecosystems and AMM pools.
6. Simplified Ecosystem Overview: View a lightweight ecosystem overview.
7. Exit: Quit the program.


Example Interaction:

Select option 2 to calculate LP rewards.
Choose a pool (e.g., HISA-USDC).
Enter liquidity amount (e.g., 1000 USD) and time period (e.g., 30 days).
View results, including:
Your liquidity and pool share
Estimated daily volume and rewards
Total rewards for the period
Estimated APY (amplified by a 16.725x multiplier)
ROI for the specified period



Example output for HISA-USDC with $1,000 liquidity over 30 days:
ðŸ“Š LIQUIDITY PROVIDER REWARDS:
Your Liquidity: $1,000.00
Your Pool Share: 0.1000%
Estimated Daily Volume: $50,000.00
Your Daily Rewards: $0.150000
Total Rewards (30 days): $4.500000
Estimated APY: 9156.94%
ROI (30 days): 0.45%



Key Components
Classes

Pool: Represents a liquidity pool with reserves, token symbols, and a constant product (k).
EcosystemPool: Defines conceptual pools within JANI, UMOJA, and CHAT ecosystems.
Ecosystem: Groups pools under an ecosystem (e.g., JANI for conservation).
HISAAMM: Core AMM implementation, managing pools, swaps, and liquidity.
RewardCalculator: Handles LP reward and arbitrage calculations.

Key Methods

HISAAMM.create_pool: Initializes a new liquidity pool.
HISAAMM.execute_swap: Performs a token swap with fee collection.
HISAAMM.add_liquidity: Adds liquidity to a pool.
RewardCalculator.calculate_lp_rewards: Estimates LP rewards, APY, and ROI.
RewardCalculator.calculate_arbitrage_opportunity: Analyzes arbitrage based on external prices.
interactive_calculator: Main entry point for the command-line interface.

Token Pairs
Supported tokens: HISA, USDC, JANI, CHAT, UMOJA, UMOJA_OPTION, JANI_STABLE, UMOJA_STABLE, HBAR.Initial pools include:

HISA-USDC
JANI-USDC
CHAT-USDC
UMOJA-USDC
JANI_STABLE-USDC
UMOJA_STABLE-USDC
UMOJA_OPTION-UMOJA
JANI-JANI_STABLE
UMOJA-UMOJA_STABLE
HBAR-USDC

Notes

APY Calculation: Uses a 30 x multiplier, resulting in high APY values (e.g., ~9156% for HISA-USDC with default settings). This is due to an assumed 5% daily trading volume of TVL and the amplified multiplier.
ROI: Calculated as (total_rewards / liquidity_value) * 100 for the specified period.
Precision: Uses Decimal for high-precision financial calculations.
Error Handling: Includes input validation and error messages for invalid inputs.

Limitations

High APY: The 30x multiplier and 5% daily volume assumption may produce unrealistic APY values. Adjust the multiplier or volume (daily_volume = total_liquidity_value * 0.05) for more realistic scenarios.
Static Prices: Token prices are derived from pool reserves, assuming USDC = 1.0. External price feeds are not integrated.
Simulation Only: This is a simulation tool and does not connect to a live blockchain or network.

Future Improvements

Add support for dynamic price feeds.
Allow customization of the APY multiplier and daily volume assumptions.
Implement impermanent loss calculations for LPs.
Add support for multi-hop swaps across pools.
